<h1>CTEC-165 wk05 VM Storage</h1>
<h2>Lab: Storage</h2>
Exercise 1 - Create VHD and VHDx
A virtual disk is a type of disk drive that works like a physical hard disk and used by computer virtualization applications such as Hyper-V and VMware. Virtual machines utilize virtual disks to run an operating system and store data files. Depending on the virtualization software that you use, virtual disks can be identified with extension names like .vmdk, .vhd and .vhdx files.

Windows Server 2016 Hyper-V supports two virtual hard disk formats namely, virtual hard disk (VHD) and VHDX.

VHDX is scalable because it supports a larger storage capacity and provides protection from data corruption during inevitable power outages. It can handle structural alignments of dynamic and differencing disks on new, large-sector physical disks.

In this exercise, you will perform the tasks required to create and configure virtual machine storage.

Congratulations, you have completed the following exercises:
    - Create VHD and VHDx
    - Modify VHDs
    - Managing VM Checkpoints
    - Working with Fibre Channel Adapter
<h2>Lab: </h2>
The Managing Virtual Machine Movement provides you with the instruction and server hardware to develop your hands on skills in the defined topics. This module includes the following exercises:
    - Prepare System Requirements for Virtual Machine Move
    - Move Virtual Machines and Hyper-V Storage
    - Exporting and Importing Virtual Machines

Windows Server 2016 Hyper-V Service supports the live migration of virtual machines from one Hyper-V server to another Hyper-V server. Although this functionality is built-in to Hyper-V server, you need to configure the options to choose like authentication protocol, maximum number of concurrent migrations, the network which can be used for live migrations and performance options.
 In this exercise, you will prepare the system requirements to ensure a successful migration of virtual machines between Hyper-V servers.
