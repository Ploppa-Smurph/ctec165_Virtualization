<h1>CTEC-165 Intro to Virtualization wk06 Managing VM Networks</h1>
<h2>Lab: The Managing Virtual Machine Networks module provides you with the instruction and server hardware to develop your hands on skills in the defined topics. This module includes the following exercises:

    - Configure Hyper-V Virtual Switches
    - Configure Network Isolation
    - Optimize Network Performance</h2> 

A virtual network switch is software-based switch that works just as a physical network switch. Ports are added or removed when virtual machines are connected to or disconnected from a virtual network.

    Hyper-V Virtual Network Manager offers three types of virtual networks:
    
    - External virtual networks. Used to provide virtual machines with access to a physical network and communicate with externally located servers and clients.
    
    - Internal virtual networks. Use to allow network communication between virtual machines on the same virtualization server and between virtual machines and the management operating system.
    
    - Private virtual network. Used to allow network communication between virtual machines on the same virtualization server. A private virtual network is not bound to a physical network adapter. 
      This type of network is used to create an isolated network environment.
